# Hybrid_-L3_Order-Book-for-High-Frequency-Trading
Notes AKA transformations:
1. Python Dictionary (self.orders = {})
The Python way: O(1) hash map lookup by order_id. The Verilog translation: Parallel Arrays (BRAMs) + Linear Scan FSM Verilog doesn't have native hash maps. Instead, I created a block of memory exactly 64 orders deep (ORDER_DEPTH = 64). I split the "Order" object into parallel arrays order_valid[], order_id_mem[], order_price[], order_qty[], and order_side[].

2. Python defaultdict (self.levels[price] += qty)
The Python way: Automatically creates a key for the price if it doesn't exist, and adds the quantity. The Verilog translation: Level Store Arrays + FSM Search Similar to the orders dict, I created a level_price[] and level_total_qty[] memory block.

When a new order arrives, the hardware FSM (in the S_ADD_LEVEL_SCAN state) physically iterates through the level_price array.
If it finds the price: it moves to S_ADD_LEVEL_UPDATE and adds w_qty.
If it hits the end without finding it: it moves to S_ADD_LEVEL_CREATE and writes a brand new entry at the level_count index.

3. Python Variables (self.bbo_bid_price, etc.)
The Python way: Standard variables. The Verilog translation: Dedicated Flip-Flop Registers This is where the FPGA crushes software. The variables best_bid_price, best_bid_qty, best_ask_price, and best_ask_qty are implemented as Flip-Flops instead of BRAM. Because they are flip-flops, the FPGA can physically wire the incoming cmd_price directly into a hardware comparator (>=) against the flip-flop output. This is why the "Surgical BBO Update" works — the hardware compares the new price, adds the new qty, and updates the BBO cache in exactly 1 clock cycle (10 nanoseconds) without looping through anything.

4. Python Heaps (heapq.heappush(self.bid_heap))
The Python way: Maintains an auto-sorting binary tree in memory. The Verilog translation: Lazy Linear Scan (S_REBUILD_SCAN) Implementing a dynamic sorted binary tree in Verilog is incredibly expensive (takes huge amounts of logic gates and routing overhead to constantly shift data around). So I deleted the heap concept entirely. Instead, because we cleverly designed the architecture to only need a rebuild when the BBO is completely wiped out, the hardware just drops into S_REBUILD_SCAN. It loops through the parallel 64-element level_price array and keeps a running track of the maximum/minimum price it sees (like a standard max() function). At 100 MHz, looping through 64 items theoretically takes 640 nanoseconds.
